# Android and Scala works well

Here you can find a working android scala template. Why i'm using scala on Android?
Scala is extremely concise, logical and extraordinarily powerful language. It does the
same in Java but with less lines of code. So its easier to keep an eye
on your app design and architecture, instead of writing verbose code.

# How to start?

1. Do a git checkout, open your preferred ide and let gradle to all the things for you.
2. Create an android application Run Config with a selected target: e.g. Nexus 5X API 22
3. Android App is shown with the name *mobile* and starts a activity for you with a small button.
